Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)\n","Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that incorporates L1 regularization to penalize the absolute values of the regression coefficients. This penalty term encourages sparsity in the model, meaning it can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection."],"metadata":{"id":"YRu4rgCvSOhL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?"],"metadata":{"id":"XLFbDTrVSe9P"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Ans. The primary advantage of using Lasso Regression for feature selection is its ability to automatically shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively eliminating irrelevant or redundant predictors from the model. This results in a sparse model that is easier to interpret, computationally efficient, and potentially improves predictive performance by reducing overfitting."],"metadata":{"id":"-MGK0ROuSm48"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q3.

Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique, meaning it models the relationship between the predictors and the target as a linear combination of the predictors. However, Lasso Regression can be adapted to handle non-linear relationships using transformations of the predictors or advanced extensions."],"metadata":{"id":"oX_aZQI6TdIz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"AXVEf-4nTmIo"}}]}
